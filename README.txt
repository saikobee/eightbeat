In a nutshell, this program is completely free and should be shared with as
many people as possible.

Windows users:
Drag a .song file onto drag-a-song-onto-me.bat to play.
Please note that as the program has not been installed yet, performance will be somewhat choppy. If you wish to speed up the program, install Ruby (http://ruby-lang.org), then use turbo-player.bat instead of drag-a-song-onto-me.bat to play

Linux users:
Make sure Ruby is installed (hopefully your distro already did that...)
In a terminal, run:
./8beat.rb SOME_SONG.song

Enjoy!
