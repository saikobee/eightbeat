In a nutshell, this program is completely free and should be shared with as
many people as possible.

----

Windows users:
Drag a `.song` file onto `player.bat` to play. You must first install the Ruby
programming language: http://ruby-lang.org

----

Linux users:
Make sure Ruby is installed (hopefully your distro already did that...)
In a terminal, run:
{{{
./8beat.rb SOME_SONG.song
}}}
For maximum performance, run (note the beep program must be installed)
{{{
./8beat.rb --beep SOME_SONG.song
}}}
This assumes beep is setuid root, if it is not then you may run
{{{
./8beat.rb --sudo --beep SOME_SONG.song
}}}
or simply run the script as root with the `--beep` option (not recommended).
If you get tired of needing root privileges, there are ways to set up
passwordless sudo that are beyond the scope if this help document
