<p>
The following is a simple example of a song file for 8-Beat.
If you have already downloaded the program, you can find the song in the 8beat
folder. Songs tend to end with a .song extension, but .txt will work just as
well.
</p>

<p>
<code><pre class="code">tempo = 60
A4 4
C5 4
C5 8; D5 8
D5 8; R  8

F5 16; E5 16; F5 16; E5 16
F5 16; E5 16; C5  8
C5  8; D5  8
D5  8; R   8
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
That was Iron Man by Black Sabbath. The syntax of
8-beat is very straightforward. The first line sets the tempo to 60 quarter
note beats per minute. The subsequent lines represent pitch values and
durations. A4 means middle A. C#2 means C sharp in the second octave. Db6 means D
flat in the sixth octave. The value after the note pitch is the note duration. A
whole note is written as 1. A half note is written as 2. A quarter notes is
written as 4, and so on. Don't forget, each note or tempo change is separated
by a semicolon.
</p>

<p>
Please note that the first line may also be written as <code class="snippet">tempo 60</code>
instead of <code class="snippet">tempo = 60;</code>. That is to say, the equals sign after a
tempo is optional, and semicolons are optional at the end of a line. This is
because semicolons serve as separators between notes and tempo statements, not
as the ending point of instruction (e.g. for programmers, the difference
between semicolons in C and Python).
</p>

<p>
If you want, you may write commas in to separate pitches from their note
values, i.e. <code class="snippet">C4, 4</code> is the same as
<code class="snippet">C4 4</code>, with spacing being entirely optional in the
version  using a comma.
</p>

<h2>Relative Octaves</h2>

<p>
The above example shows a song using absolute octaves. The example below shows
the different ways of using relative octaves.
</p>

<p>
<code><pre class="code">tempo = 120

octave = 4
C 4; D 4; E 4; F 4; G 4; A 4; B 4

octave up
C 4; D 4; E 4; F 4; G 4; A 4; B 4

octave down
C 4; D 4; E 4; F 4; G 4; A 4; B 4

octave 0
+; C 4; +; D 4; +; E 4; +; F 4; +; G 4; +; A 4; +; B 4
-; C 4; -; D 4; -; E 4; -; F 4; -; G 4; -; A 4; -; B 4

Octave=4
C 16; OCTAVE=5; C 16; +++; C 16 --; C 16
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>
This example is obviously a little less pretty, but it displays the
flexibility of 8-Beat's syntax. Spacing is irrelevant in octave directives,
just like tempo directives, and equals signs are optional. Octaves may be
specified absolutely such as <code class="snippet">octave = 4</code> or
relatively, such as <code class="snippet">octave up</code>,
<code class="snippet">octave down</code>, <code class="snippet">+</code>,
or <code class="snippet">-</code>.
</p>

<h2>Implied Duration</h2>

<p>
The last basic feature to cover is implied note durations. Whenever you fail
to mention the duration of a note, 8-Beat will assume what you mean. At the
beginning of a song, the duration of notes is assumed to be quarter note
length. This can be changed at any point throughout the song, just like octave
or tempo. See the example below.
</p>

<p>
<code><pre class="code">C; D; E; F; G; A; B

duration = 16
C; D; E; F; G; A; B

duration = 32
C; D; E; F; G; A; B

C; D; E; duration=16; G; A; B
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>
It may be worth noting that in this last example, the final G, A, and B notes
are played with a sixteenth note duration, whereas the C, D, and E notes
before it are thirty-second notes.
