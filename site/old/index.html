<p>
<span class="eight-beat">8-beat</span> is a music creation system that allows you to express
music in plain text and play it through your PC speaker (the thing that beeps
inside your computer).

<h2>Basic Song Example</h2>

<p>
The file below shows a very memorable portion of well-known song.
</p>

<pre><code>tempo 60;
A4, 4;
C5, 4;
C5, 8; D5, 8;
D5, 8; R, 8;

F5, 16; E5, 16; F5, 16; E5, 16;
F5, 16; E5, 16; C5, 8;
C5, 8; D5, 8;
D5, 8: R, 8;
</code></pre>

<p>
That was Iron Man by Black Sabbath. The syntax of
8-beat is very straightforward. The first line sets the tempo to 60 quarter
note beats per minute. The subsequent lines represent pitch values and
durations. A4 means middle A. C#2 means C sharp in the second octave. Db6 means D
flat in the sixth octave. The value after the comma is the note duration. A
whole note is written as 1. A half note is written as 2. A quarter notes is
written as 4, and so on. Don't forget, each note or tempo change is separated
by a semicolon.
