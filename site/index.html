<p>
8-Beat is a music creation system that allows you to express
music in plain text and play it through your PC speaker (the thing that beeps
inside your computer).
</p>

<p>
8-Beat is a flexible language. It is almost entirely case insensitive, many
pieces of syntax may be omitted for brevity, and it provides many ways of
doing the same thing. For example, there are many ways of providing octave
change directives to 8-Beat. These range from hardcoded octaves attached to
notes, to <code class="snippet">octave = 5</code>, even to the extremeley
terse <code class="snippet">+</code>.
